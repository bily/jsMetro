# jsMetro ReadMe

jsMetro ([jsmetro.johnsedlak.com](http://jsmetro.johnsedlak.com)) is a set of jQuery/js functions created with a goal of bringing Metro design elements to the web. The secondary goal is to learn about jQuery plugin and general javascript development.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to view the samples at [jsmetro.johnsedlak.com](http://jsmetro.johnsedlak.com) which is a live version of the master branch.

## Contributing

If you want to help/contribute, I am looking for complete Metro widgets and the like that follow the specs & guidelines set forth by the existing js files. In the future I will update this with a stricter set of guidelines.

## Live Samples & Demos
