# jsMetro ReadMe

jsMetro ([jsmetro.johnsedlak.com](http://jsmetro.johnsedlak.com)) is a set of jQuery/js functions created with a goal of bringing Metro design elements to the web. The secondary goal is to learn about jQuery plugin and general javascript development.

## Releases

* Latest - [jsMetro 1.2.6](https://github.com/downloads/jsedlak/jsMetro/jsMetro-1.2.6.zip)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to view the samples at [jsmetro.johnsedlak.com](http://jsmetro.johnsedlak.com) which is a live version of the master branch. The jsMetro Framework includes **Notify**, **Dialog**, **Collapsible**, **ScrollTo**, **Map** and some associated HTML/CSS tools & styles.

### Notify

Notify ($.js.notify) is a simple function that creates a WP7-like Notification at the top of the browser window.

### Dialog

Dialog (WIP) ($.js.dialog) creates a modal dialog with programmable options and content.

### Collapsible

The Collapsible function ($.fn.collapsible) collapses elements and allows users to toggle visibility via a second element.

### ScrollTo

ScrollTo ($.fn.scrollTo) provides smoothly animated scrolling to any element.

### Map

Map ($.js.map) is a basic data-to-DOM mapping function to help populate the DOM with JSON data.

## Contributing

If you want to help/contribute, I am looking for complete Metro widgets and the like that follow the specs & guidelines set forth by the existing js files. In the future I will update this with a stricter set of guidelines.
